## About The Project


*This Capstone project is a website built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We were tasked with making a basic website that sold a particular product which allowed for the the user to add a product/products to a shopping-cart which the user can then navigate to(checkout) and proceed with the purchase. The user information is stored in the localStorage using JSON and this allows us to record the information that the user inputs whilst navigating our website.*

## Usage

The BRAASH website allows the user to navigate seamlessly from one page to another. Once the user lands on the Homepage, the user has the option of going to the following pages:
* About us
* Catalogue
* Contact us
* Shopping cart


These pages are all self-explanatory, the page I'd like to focus on is the 'Catalogue' page which allows the user to add one/multiple prints to the users shopping cart. Once the user is satified with their cart, they can proceed to checkout. There are discount coupons, delivery options and location settings which can influence the final price. The user will be alerted with a final price and a unique reference number once they've checked out.
